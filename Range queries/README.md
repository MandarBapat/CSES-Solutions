## Range queries

Solutions to some of the range query problems that I have solved so far.

Some key algorithms and data structures:

1. **Segment trees**

     I have followed the code from GeeksforGeeks for implementing a segment tree. Although the implementation is lengthy, it can be modified to solve any segment tree problem.

2. **Prefix sum calculations**

     In some questions, calculating the prefix sums/minimums/maximums or any other quantity related to the question, is very useful.
