## Graph problems

Solutions to some of the graph problems that I have solved so far.

Some key algorithms and data structures:

1. **Graph traversals**

     Some of the common problems like finding shortest path, number of connected components, reachability, ancestors, articulation points and bridges, finding if the graph is bipartite or not or equivalently if it is 2-colorable or not can be solved using BFS or DFS 

2. **Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford**

3. **Flood flow**

     See counting rooms problem
     
4. **Topological sorting**

     Many of the problems in DAGs can be solved using topological sorting

5. **Kosaraju's algorithm**

6. **Max flow algorithm**

7. **Kruskal's and Prim's algorithm**
     
     Finding MST using union find
