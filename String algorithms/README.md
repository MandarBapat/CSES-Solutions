## String algorithms

Solutions to some of string algorithm problems that I have solved so far.

Some key algorithms and data structures:

1. **Z algorithm**

     Used in string matching and finding borders question. I find it easier to implement and understand than the KMP algorithm.
     
2. **KMP algorithm**

     Same as Z algorithm. But can be preferred over Z in some questions.

3. **Concatenation**

     Sometimes concatenating a string with itself can help in some problems, especially in problems involving rotation of a string.
