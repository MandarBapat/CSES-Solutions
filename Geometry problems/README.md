## Geometry problems

Solutions to some of the geometry problems that I have solved so far.

Some key algorithms and data structures:

1. **Using complex number library of C++**

     Using complex numbers as vectors or tuples can solve many elementary problems like finding out the intersection of line segments.
 
2. **Pick's theorem**

     See Pick's theorem for finding out area of a lattice polygon
     
3. **Shoelace formula**

     Finding out the area of a polygon given its vertices.
