## Introductory problems

Solutions to some of the introductory problems that I have solved so far.

Some key algorithms and data structures:

1. **Permutation and Combination**

     Certain problems can be solved by analysing them using P and C and creating a general forumla for the problem in terms of the variables. See two knights problem
     
2. **Simulation**

     Certain problems simply involved running a naive simulation on the problem description
     
3. **Modular arithmetic**

     See two sets problem

4. **Recursion**

     Other problems involved finding a recursive procedure to solve them
