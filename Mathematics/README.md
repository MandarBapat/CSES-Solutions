## Mathematics

Solutions to some of the mathematics problems that I have solved so far.

Some key algorithms and data structures:

1. **Binary exponentiation**

     One of the most useful and key algorithms for quickly evaluating large powers of a number. The idea can be extended to matrices too and is useful in calculating large Fibonacci numbers without using much space
     
2. **Fermat's little theorem**

     Helpful in calculating modular inverse of a number in special cases and calculating very huge powers of a particular number in special cases(see exponentiation2 question).

3. **Minimizing the sum |x - a<sub>1</sub>| + |x - a<sub>2</sub>| ... |x - a<sub>n</sub>|**

     Minimized when x is the median of a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub> ... a<sub>n</sub>

4. **Calculating binomial coefficients**

     See dynamic programming solution to find binomial coefficients **n choose k**

5. **Nim sum game and Grundy numbers**

     See Nim games for how to solve such game theory problems

6. **Catalan numbers**

     Catalan numbers keep popping up in a variety of problems
