## Tree algorithms

Solutions to some of the tree problems that I have solved so far.

Some key algorithms and data structures:

1. **Tree traversals**
     
     Some important tree traversals are:
     
     a. Recursive Inorder, Preorder, Postorder
     b. Non-recursive Inorder, Preorder, Postorder using stacks
     c. Level order, Reverse level order and Zig zag order
     d. Diagnol order

2. **Lowest common ancestor**

3. **Recursive**

     Problems on trees often involve a recursive solution to them. See maximum depth, minimum depth, number of nodes, node deletion, and mirror tree problems
